Challenge: Thinking in React

- [Instructor] This is how the user interface looks like for now. We have a navigation bar and a gallery of images. The goal for this challenge is to learn to think in React. Learn to split and organize the code base into small chunks of code. Divide the user interface into small units and reusable components. So what you should keep in mind is that one component is one responsibility. One component should represent only one visual section of the entire UI. So we want to understand how to reuse components and pass data with the props to create reusable and flexible components. So the purpose here is to understand, not to keep a big file with a huge component with everything in it. Just like this navigation, it's very busy. We have a lot of things. We have a navigation, a search and a dropdown. So what we can see right here is that we have three separate components to make the navigation bar. So the challenge for you is to learn to think in React by dividing the code base and user interface into reusable and flexible components, and make sure that we keep responsibilities separate. The ultimate goals and learning objectives is to learn to keep the code simple, well-maintained and tidy. And we'll see the solution in the next video to see how to think and React, improve code usability and scalability, and see how we can manage to achieve a nice user interface with a clean and organized code base.
