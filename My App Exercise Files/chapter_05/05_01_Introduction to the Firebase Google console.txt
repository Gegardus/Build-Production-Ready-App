So there are a few requirements in order to get started with Firebase. So first, you should have a Google account in order to connect and then access the Google console. And if you already have one, so that's fine, you should be able to get right into it. So you should visit this website, and then connect with your Gmail account just like me. And so there are a few services that we're going to discover provided by Firebase, so first, Cloud Firestore in order to create a new SQL database and store in synchronized data in your application. You also have the cloud storage in order to create a bucket and download media, and create rich visual content. Then you're going to be able to allow users to connect to your applications with Firebase authentication. So there are different sign-in methods provided available. And finally, you're going to have also Firebase Hosting to deploy your applications to the cloud. So it's time for us to get started with the Firebase Cloud solutions.
